## Overview

### Links

- https://darkgamerxdoff.github.io/QRCodeComponent/ 

### Built with

- Simple HTML5
- Basic CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the first real page that I have created following a design. 
I tried my best to make it a similar as possible but I am not sure about the sizes. 
I tried to make the code as clean as possible and use logical solutions. 
I am not too familiar with flexbox but that's mostly because I haven't worked with it a lot. 
It just made most sense to me to use it in this project. 
I think I may have overdone it a little but I guess I'll get better at it the more I work with it.


### Continued development

Layouts for me are real killers. 
It just takes a lot of trial and error before I get it right.
And sometimes I just see layouts that my mind can't comprehend.
Working on this is my biggest priority right now.
